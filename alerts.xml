The driver of the second vehicle had escaped (no FD extrication needs) and was evaluated by firefighter/paramedics on scene. The patient is in good condition, but is being taken to the hospital as a precaution due to the amount of force of the collision. LAPD Inc #4443. Nothing further. ; FS 105; Batt 17; Valley Bureau; Council District 3; BC17  E105  E106  E305  E84  EM14  EM17  HR3  RA105  RA106  T105  UR88; CH8; 17; Nicholas Prange</description>

Firefighters quickly divided the tasks between companies, and went to work to contain the fires (tree, rubbish, brush) and protect the structure. It took 30 firefighters 38 minutes (6:54pm) to extinguish the flames, keeping the brush fire relatively small, and protecting all but the top layer of roofing on the commercial building. No reported injuries. Cause under investigation.; FS 2; Batt 1; Central Bureau; Council District 14; BC1  E17  E209  E25  E4  E9  T9; CH7; 14; Nicholas Prange</description>

  <description>Update Hazardous Materials Investigation; INC#0303; 11:30AM; LAX Terminal 8 Baggage Area; MAP: &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3TU0Td6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://bit.ly/3TU0Td6&lt;/a&gt;; Westchester; The one worker earlier upgraded from Grave to Critical condition at hospital arrival - and earlier described as a male in his 50's, has now been confirmed to be a 36 year-old male contract worker at the airport. His craft, employer and the specific nature of work being performed within the *subterranean* utility room, have not been specified. Though LAFD has no update on his status, "he has certainly been given a fighting chance of survival thanks to the prompt and well-coordinated teamwork of LAPD, LAX PD and LAFD first responders". The LAFD does identify receiving hospitals, and may not be able to offer any updates on the man's status. The incident is being investigated by Cal-OSHA.; - Brian Humphrey</description>

  <description>Update Hazardous Materials Investigation; INC#0303; 08:45AM; LAX Terminal 8 Baggage Area; MAP: &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3TU0Td6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://bit.ly/3TU0Td6&lt;/a&gt;; Westchester; The reported release of Carbon Dioxide took place in a utility room within the airport, more than 200' from the Terminal 8 Baggage Area. Though NO passengers/travelers were directly affected by the release, in the interest of safety, airport officials moved as many as 100 persons from Terminal 8 to Terminal 7 in a calm and orderly manner. The four persons who took suddenly ill (3 adult males and 1 adult female) were all workers in or near that (unknown size) utility room, when a popping sound was heard, and the apparent release of Carbon Dioxide vapor took place. Three of the four workers (2 males, 1 female) have been treated at scene for minor complaints. The fourth worker, described as a male in his 50's, was found pulseless and non-breathing inside the utility room. He was provided prompt CPR and advanced life support by LAFD Paramedics, with continuing advanced medical care during transport to an area hospital. His condition was upgraded from grave to critical on hospital arrival. LAFD Hazardous Materials experts have closely examined the area with sophisticated instruments, and discovered only trace residue of Carbon Dioxide remaining within the utility room.  No escalating or off-site hazard was identified. LAFD responders are utilizing portable fans to further ventilate the immediate area to outside air.  Airline passengers are encouraged to follow the @FlyLAXairport Twitter account: ( https://twitter.com/flyLAXairport ) for updates, and to check with their airline for any updates on flights. ; FS 51; Batt 4; West Bureau; Council District 11; BC4  E205  E21  E221  E294  E51  E94  EM9  JT4  RA51  RA63  RA867  RA95  SQ21  T21  T5  T94; CH7; 13; - Brian Humphrey</description>
